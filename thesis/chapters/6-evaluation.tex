\section{Single Quadrotor Control with Payload}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Recover from harsh and track position
    \item Follow trajectory
    \item Follow trajectory with disturbance
    \item Plots recovery: Recovery success rate for 10000 rollouts ofver time.
    \item Plots Traj: Trajectory following 3d, error over time for batch
    \item Plots Disturbance: Trajectory following with disturbance, error over time for batch

\end{itemize}
